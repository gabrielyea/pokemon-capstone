# JavaScript capstone project - PokeH
> PokeH is a web application based on an external API. It retrieves information from two different API's: [PokeApi](https://pokeapi.co/) and [InvolmentAPI from Microverse](https://www.notion.so/Involvement-API-869e60b5ad104603aa6db59e08150270) and brings new functionality by mixing both.
